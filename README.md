📘 Software Testing Fundamentals Course Repository

This repository contains all assignments and projects undertaken during my journey through the Software Testing Fundamentals course on Coursera. This course delves deep into the principles and processes of software testing, and has equipped me with the skills to:

    📋 Design and run test cases using automated testing tools.
    🧪 Understand and differentiate between verification and validation.
    🎯 Understand the primary goals of testing and communicate using accurate test terminologies such as test fixture, test script, test oracle, and more.
    ⚪️⚫️ Dive into the nuances of white and black box testing.
    🔄 Analyze test-first and test-last development techniques.
    📊 Measure test adequacy via statement and branch coverage.
    💡 Understand the intricacies of mutation testing and ascertain the efficiency of a functional test suite.
    📖 Assess the strengths and limitations of both black-box and white-box testing in software development.
    🎲 Differentiate among various test oracles like expected-value, heuristic, and consistency.
    💻 Develop unit and integration test cases, and automate these using JUnit, supported by test doubles like stubs and mocks, as outlined by Martin Fowler.

🎯 Target Audience: This course and, by extension, this repository, is immensely beneficial for individuals aspiring to be Software Engineers, Software Engineers in Test, Test Automation Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, Programmers, or any computer enthusiast. A basic understanding of Java (or a similar OOP language) and the Software Development Lifecycle is recommended.
